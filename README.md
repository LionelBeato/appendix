# Glossary

*Repo for the definition of OOP/Java related terms.*

## A

- *abstract/abstract class* : in Java, a class implementation that must be overridden if extended. Abstract code has no direct implementation when declared.

- *abstraction* : the concept that code implementation should be hidden or obfuscated.

## B

- *best practice(s)* : an established way of doing things. 

- *byte code* : compact, portable code that can be compiled into machine-code.

## C

- *class* : a discrete grouping of data that can be instatiated.

- *code smell* : something that indicates poorly written code.

- *compiling* : to convert source code into machine-code or byte code.

- *compiler* : a program that converts--or *compiles*--code.

## D

- *design pattern* : a reusable solution or methodology that addresses a specific problem. 

- *dark pattern* : a design pattern that is typically user-aggressive or exploitative. 

## E

- *encapsulation* : the concept that code can be wrapped or contained by other code for safety and security purposes. Variables and methods that act on those variables should then be bundled together. 

## F

- *flavor* : a specific version of a technology stack that has unique implementation. For instance, mySQL is a *flavor* of SQL.

## I

- *IDE* : this stands for integrated-development-environment. It defines the development tool you use to write your code. Think *Intellij* or *Eclipse*. 

- *inheritance* : the concept that objects can have properties that stem from parent objects; "the child can do everything the parent can, plus more." 

- *interface* : a class that does not have implementation and which other classes can implement.

## M

- *machine code* : a set of instructions that can be easily understood by a CPU. 

- *microservice* : a loosely coupled architectural design pattern that emphasizes small modular services. Compare/contrast with *monolith*. 

- *middleware* : code that is packaged and used as boilerplate for your application. 

- *monolith* : a design pattern that emphasizes the use of a single codebase for all major functionalities. Thus, the frontend, backend, and database will all live in one project. 

## O

- *object* : a variable that may represent data/values in whatever structure. In class-based languages, an object refers to an *instance* of a class. 

## P

- *portability* : in regards to software, the ability to run on many different kinds of computers without augmentation.

- *polymorphism* : the concept that objects can behave like other objects, or more succinctly: "“same name, different logic”. 

- *primitive* : a data type that is typically a basic building block of a language and denotes a value.

- *push*, *pushing* : in reference to git, to sync code with a remote repository.

- *pull*, *pulling* : in reference to git, to sync code with a local repository. 

<!-- provider definition -->

## R

- *refactor* : to change code for the better. 

- *reference* : a value that represents an indirectly accessed piece of data, or 'datum'. 

- *remote* : in reference to git, a repository that is not located locally. 

- *repository* : in reference to git, a collection of files representing a project, typically composed of source code.

## S

- *source code* : the human readable, programmed code for an application.

## T

- *type casting* : to assign the value of one primitive to another.

- *Test Driven Development* : a software development process in which tests are written first before main classes are implemented. This follows the cycle of having tests fails, refactoring, and testing again to see if tests will pass.

## #4

- *The 4 Pillars of OOP* : The major concepts and design patterns that are the backbone for object-oriented programming. The 4 Pillars are as followed:
    1. *Abstraction*
    2. *Encapsulation*
    3. *Inheritance*
    4. *Polymorphism*
